/**
 * @class Correctness
 * @description
 * The Correctness class is responsible for calculating the correctness score of a repository.
 * The correctness score is determined based on the ratio of closed issues to total issues.
 * This class extends the Metric class and provides methods to calculate the score by
 * analyzing the repository's issues.
 *  
 * @example
 * // Creating an instance of Correctness
 * const urlHandler = new URLHandler('https://github.com/user/repo');
 * const correctness = new Correctness(urlHandler);
 * 
 * // Calculating the correctness score
 * await correctness.calculateScore();
 * 
 * @param {URLHandler} url - An instance of URLHandler to handle URL-related operations.
 * 
 * @method calculateScore(): Promise<void>
 * Calculates the correctness score by analyzing the repository's issues.
 * 
 * @method getIssueCountByState(state  'open' | 'closed'): Promise<number>
 * Fetches the count of issues in the repository based on the state (open or closed).
 * 
 * @method getIssueCounts(): Promise<[number, number]>
 * Fetches the count of open and closed issues in the repository.
 *
